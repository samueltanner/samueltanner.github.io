								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>I have spent the better part of the last decade turning my ideas into reality. From mobile apps, to consumer products, to collaborative sponorships... in all of my pursuits I've operated under a central thesis: </p>
									
									<p><em>Learn as much as possible, get comfortable with discomfort, and fail fast.</em></p>

									<h3>Creating New Ideas</h3>
									<p>I love the creative process. There is nothing more exciting than seeing a rough idea take shape and quickly evolve a into dynamic and collaborative project.</p>

									<h3>Complex Problem Solving</h3>
									<p>I always throw myself into the deep-end and learn by doing. Whether I am doing sales or building software, my comfort zone is a boundry I aim to push.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-handshake">
									<h3>Building Strong Relationships</h3>
									<p>Humans' primary currency is social interaction. Kindness, respect, inclusivity, and diversity are the pillars that make us all richer. I am drawn to businesses, ideas, and indivduals who are equally committed to promoting these ideals. </p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-photo-video">
									<h3>Developing Cohesive Brands</h3>
									<p>I am incredibly sensitive to the way things look, feel, and sound. I've used this sensitivity to develop the hard skills necessary to take design concepts and turn them into beautiful, tangible products.</p>
								</li>
						
								<li class="icon solid fa-chart-line">
									<h3>Growing and Adapting</h3>
									<p>Every venture I have pursued has had multiple, devistating failures. Each one of these potential end-points inpsired new paths forward. When an idea breaks, I figure out why, adapt, and keep going. </p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-hiking">
									<h3>Exploring and Seeking Joy</h3>
									<p>I am a huge fan of life and I try to fit in as much as possible. I am someone who rarely sits still because there is so much to see and experience. This is the energy I bring into everything I puruse.</p>

						<h2>Venture #4:<br />
						A Deep Dive Into Personal Growth</h2>
						<p>Currently I am enrolled in a full-stack software development bootcamp. My career as an entrepreneur began in tech but I was always on the business development side. Frankly, engineering intimidated me and I assumed I wasn't smart enough. This year I decided to challenge that belief.</p>

						<p>I have fallen in love with the logic puzzle that is coding and have become obsessed with turning my ideas into working prototypes in the blink of an eye!</p>

						<h2>Venture #3:<br />
							The C.D.S & New Wilderness Essays</h2>
						<p>In 2017 I created the Caveman Dirtbag Sponsorship as a namesake for my friend, "Caveman," who was thru-hking the Pacific Crest Trail. Through partnerships with companies like Patagonia and Arc'Teryx, we fully equipped our sponsees with cash, gear, and food. The C.D.S. would come to be recognized as a preeminent outdoor sponsorship by hikers all over the world.</p>
						<p>Now I'm working an even more ambitious outdoor sponsorship, The New Wilderness Essays. Our goal is to discover the next generation of awe-inspiring storytellers. Check out our progress <a href="https://nwessays.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> </p>

						<h2>Venture #2:<br />
						Joe Chocolate Co.</h2>
						<p>In 2016 I launched Joe Chocolate Co. out of a class project at the University of Washington. Over the next five years we grew the business into a nationally distributed consumer product on the shelves of Whole Foods, REI, and Nordstrom. In 2019 we opened our first retail store, centrally located in the heart of Seattle's Pike Place Market. The Joe Chocoalte Co. Cafe & Mocha Bar is now recognized as an international destination and a core part of the Pike Place Market Community. </p>

						<p>I exited my role as CEO in 2020. Joe Chocolate Co. is still producing amazing chocolate and coffee creations. Learn more <a href="https://joechocolateco.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

						<h2>Venture #1:<br />
						CardSwapper</h2>
						<p>In 2012 I founded Cardswapper, a peer-to-peer trading platform for unwanted gift cards. With a small team of undergraduate students, we launched an app on the iOS store that could facilitate trading, and eventually, liquidation of gift cards. Over the course of this venture, I also filed and received a patent from the USPTO and partnered with the worlds largest gift card marketplace.</p>
							
						<p>I departed from my role as CEO of CardSwapper in 2016. You can learn more about CardSwapper as it exists today <a href="https://cardsell.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

								<h2>My transition back to tech</h2>
								<p>I have learned invaluable lessons through the companies I have founded and the multitude of fascinating people I've met along the way. Through these ventures and relationships, I have exponentially grown my resiliency, patience, creativity, and business acumen. Occupying the role of leader has also led me to deeply understand my shortcomings and the skills I need to work on next.</p>

								<p>At the end of 2020 I decided to leave my role as founder and dive into the world of sofware, not with the hopes of starting my next business, but with motivation to join a team of professionals I can learn and grow with. My goals are to become a better leader, ideator, and engineer within a team of highly motivated, diverse, and interesting people.</p>
